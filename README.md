# AI for Research: Writing Effective Prompts for Coding with LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to advance your research.  However the quality and efficiency of this interaction often strongly depend on the prompts you provide to the LLM.  In this workshop I will cover tips, strategies and best practices for engineering your prompts to maximize your research and coding productivity.

Much of these materials are from Emilio Lehoucq from Northwestern IT RCDS.
